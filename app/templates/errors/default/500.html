    <h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
    <p>Hmm.. I guess something went wrong, huh?</p>
    <p>
        Either the server is dying or you are trying to break something, whether it was intentional or not.
        Or maybe contabo is just trolling us again. Who knows?
        Anyway, please try again later or contact the server administrator.

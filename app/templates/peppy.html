        Messaging Levi
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        You were most likely trying to message Levi, however, peppy, the original creator of osu! has disabled in-game messaging to him.
        Levi uses the same user ID as peppy; due to this, you can't send him a message directly. <br><br>

        But don't worry! You can still reach him in-game by using the <b>!asklevi</b> command.
